<section><span style="font-size: 10px;">It's hard to believe this day has come again...</span></section>
<section>Welcome to the latest update of this mod! It's now available for 1.14. And 1.15. And 1.16. For both Fabric and Forge.</section>
<section>The main highlight of this update is the ability to create waterlogged light sources.</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section><strong>What is this mod all about?</strong></section>
<section>You probably know that you need a lot of torches to keep your house well lit. You might also try using glowstone, but then realize it doesn't look great either.</section>
<section>As the mod name suggests, this mod allows you to place invisible light sources. You won't even notice they are there!</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>You could turn this:</section>

<section>This mod adds one item: the Rod of Light. (It also adds a block for technical reasons, but you don't really have to worry about that.)</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>Here's how to make one:</section>
<section><img src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/300/146/recipe_light_rod.png" alt="" width="480" height="288" /></section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>To place a light source, you'll need some glowstone dust in your inventory (unless you are in creative mode). Hold the rod in either your mainhand or offhand and right-click on a surface. Placing a light source consumes two glowstone dust.</section>
<section>Now the best part is you can make the light sources visible! To do that, sneak and right-click the rod of light. You'll hear a <em>ding</em> sound effect and should notice that all placed light sources have turned visible. You could break them now and even get your glowstone back.</section>
<section>To make everything nicely hidden again, do another sneak right-click.</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>You can also upgrade your rod to the powered version by attaching some redstone to it!</section>

<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>The powered version can be charged in any Forge Energy compatible charger, and uses some of that energy to place light sources. Please note that the powered rod of light is only available in the Forge version at the moment.</section>
