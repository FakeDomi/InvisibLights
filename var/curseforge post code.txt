<section>This mod has finally been updated to 1.12! Version 1.13 <em>might</em> come at a later point.</section>

<section><strong>What is this mod all about?</strong></section>
<section>You probably know that you need a lot of Torches to keep your house well-lit. You could also use Glowstone, but that is very bulky and doesn't look great either.</section>
<section>As the title suggests this mod allows you to place light sources that are invisible. You won't even notice they are there!</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>

<section>This mod adds one item: the Rod of Light. (It also adds a block for technical reasons, but you don't have to worry about that one.)</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>Here's how to craft it:</section>
<section><img src="https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/248/465/recipe_light_rod.png" alt="" width="480" height="288" /></section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>To place a light source, you need some Glowstone dust in your inventory (unless you are in creative mode). Hold the Rod into your main- or offhand and right-click on a block surface. Placing a light source consumes two Glowstone dust by default (config option).</section>
<section>Now the best part is you can make the light sources visible! To do that, sneak and right-click the Rod of Light. You'll hear a <em>ding</em> sound effect and notice all placed light sources are visible now. You can break them while they can be seen, and even get your Glowstone back (also a config option).</section>
<section>To make everything nicely hidden again, do another sneak right-click.</section>
<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>You can even upgrade it to the powered version by attaching some Redstone to it!</section>

<section>&nbsp;</section>
<section>The powered version can be charged in any Forge Energy compatible charger, and uses that power to place light sources instead of Glowstone.</section>
